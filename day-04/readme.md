# Day 04 – Project-Based Learning 🚀⚛️

After completing the React basics, I started building a **food delivery application using React** to apply what I’ve learned in a real project.

This marks the beginning of **project-based learning**, where concepts are implemented practically instead of only studying theory.

---

## 📌 What I Started on Day 04

- Began developing a food app using React
- Applied React fundamentals learned in previous days
- Focused on understanding project structure and component-based design
- Transitioned from basic examples to a real-world application

---

## 🍔 Project: QuickBite

The food application is being developed under a separate repository named **QuickBite**.

👉 **Check out the QuickBite repository for future updates and continued learning progress.**

This project will be used to:
- Practice React concepts
- Build features step by step
- Learn by implementing real use cases

---

## 🎯 Learning Approach

- Project-based learning
- Hands-on implementation
- Continuous improvement and iteration

---

## ✅ Summary

Day 04 represents a shift from learning React fundamentals to applying them in a real-world project. All future enhancements and learnings related to the food app will be updated in the **QuickBite** repository.
